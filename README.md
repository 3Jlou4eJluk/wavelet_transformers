# Wavelet Transformers

This is repository for my scientific work code.

## Results
1. A **new augmentation algorithm** has been developed(for images).
2. **The accuracy of 0.9943** has been achieved on the cinic-10 dataset.

## Resources
1. RTX 3070m with 16gb VRAM (Unofficial Chinese assembly).
2. Training time - 13 hours.


## Here you can find
1. **Wavelet Augmentations** for images
2. **Inisights for training** neural network
3. Different approaches to train Visual Transformer Model
